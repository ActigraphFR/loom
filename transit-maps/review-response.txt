Review 1
--------

D2 (limited application domain) + D3 (motivation) + D4 (previous work on metro-map drawing): The main focus of research over the last two decades was targeted at producing schematic (generalized, octilinear) skeletons of transit maps, called "metro maps". This is what one would expect in print. However, the motivation for this paper was to produce transit maps on a global scale as overlays for map services like OSM or Google Maps. For this, geographical accuracy is absolutely essential. Producing and maintaining such accurate transit map overlays on a global scale for ten-thousands of transportation networks by hand is virtually infeasible, and we know of no published work on doing this automatically. The need for such a tool becomes also clear if you look at the current "transit overlay" feature of Google Maps (Figure 10, left in the paper): the lines are often not continuous, swap colors from one segment to the next, and are sometimes drawn on top of each other.

D5 (comparison to state of the art, why is such a method not already used in practice): As mentioned above, Google Maps provides a transit map overlay, but they do not publish their approach, experiences or difficulties. Our best guess from painful experience is simply that existing work on this problem never adresses the entire end-to-end pipeline, but only subproblems, which makes a real-world implementation quite complicated.

D6 (comparison to hand-drawn maps, user studies): We considered this, but came to the conclusion that a user study would have gone beyond the scope of this paper. We did, however, compare the results of our line ordering optimization to manually designed maps (Section 6.2). User studies based on our tool (evaluating maps rendered with varying parameters) would be a very interesting direction for future work.

D8 (reference for claim that existing maps are drawn by hand): This is the impression one of the authors got after collaborating with a large public transport company for a few years.

D9 (static map vs. interactive map): Rendering static, pixel-based map overlays is optional. Our approach can easily be used to render (for example) maps based on vector graphics (outputted either as SVG or GeoJSON), which may then be used to provide interactions like clicking on stations or single lines.


Review 3
--------

W1 (consistency of ILP solution times) + W2 (additional heuristics): Agreed. We will mention this as "future work" in the final version.

D1 (clarification of Eq. 1): Also agreed, we will try to make this clearer.

D2 + D3 (typos): Thank you very much, this will be fixed in the final version.
