Parallel line snapping
======================

* be more exact! handle edge cases! this has to work 100%!
* NO artifacts!
* dont snap to stations! or: snap with smaller threshold!

Node front expansion
===================

* new criteria: not distance, but length a front has to be expanded to intersect
  with another front!

Drawing
=======

* direction arrows
* line names
* dirs at last station
* better station name placement

Preprocessing
=============

* maybe auto-generate colors if no colors are present? or move to gtfstidy?????
* join routes that serve the same routes, but in different directions (new york feed...)
