Grid ILP
=======

The penalties for angles can be skipped for deg 8 nodes, for nodes of lower degree it is possible to derive a maximum and minimum possible angle between pairs based on the number of edges between them!

Node front expansion
===================

* new criteria: not distance, but length a front has to be expanded to intersect
  with another front!

Drawing
=======

* direction arrows
* line names
* dirs at last station
* better station name placement

Preprocessing
=============

* maybe auto-generate colors if no colors are present? or move to gtfstidy?????
* join routes that serve the same routes, but in different directions (new york feed...)

Thesis
=====

* If same-route lines are combined into a single new line K, it may not be a good idea to assign a random ordering to them. Instead, order them so that they can be distinguished easily (dont put an orange next to a red color)
