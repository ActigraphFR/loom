Parallel line snapping
======================

* what if we do 2 steps - one with a small distance value (to catch equal lines), one with the
  normal one?

* filtering for topological nodes that serve no purpose (1 in, 1 out), just leads to artifacts

Node front expansion
===================

* new criteria: not distance, but length a front has to be expanded to intersect
  with another front!

Drawing
=======

* direction arrows
* line names
* dirs at last station
* better station name placement

Preprocessing
=============

* maybe auto-generate colors if no colors are present? or move to gtfstidy?????
* join routes that serve the same routes, but in different directions (new york feed...)
