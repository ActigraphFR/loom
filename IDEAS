Parallel line snapping
======================

* use dynamic max distance based on width of compared geometries (use existing getTotalWidth() method for that)
* "crossing" detection. if the route part before the shared segment is on the opposite site of the compared route than
  the part after the shared segment (maybe for a min distance?), consider this matching a crossing and don't snap it

Drawing
=======

* station rendering
* direction arrows

Preprocessing
=============

* maybe auto-generate colors if no colors are present? or move to gtfstidy?????
* join routes that serve the same routes, but in different directions (new york feed...)
